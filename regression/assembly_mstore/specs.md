The contract has only the function `f` that executes inline assembly to change the value of `sm.x` with the value `i`:
```
function f() public {
    s.x = 42;
    S memory sm = s;
    uint256 i = 7;
    assembly {
        mstore(sm, i)
    }
    s = sm;
}
```

The property `struct-store` should pass since we know the value `i`.
