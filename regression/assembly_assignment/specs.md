The contract has only the function `f` that executes inline assembly to assign `2` to `x` and then it returns `x`:
```
function f(uint x) public pure returns (uint) {
    assembly {
        x := 2
    }
    return x;
}
```

The property `f-return-correct-x` should pass since we know the return value.
