# Simplified Deflationary Token

## Specification
This contract implements a simplified version of a deflationary token using `uint256`, where each transaction is charged a fixed fee (10% from the amount of tokens sent).
The contract deployer will get ownership and total token amount and heâ€™ll be excluded from paying transaction fees moreover can decide whether to exclude or include any user from paying them.

## Properties
- **liquidity**: Senders with a positive amount of tokens can always send the amount minus the fee.
- **owner-can-exclude-include-from-fee**: Owner can include or exclude everyone in the fee payment.
- **owner-fee-after-transfer**: To respect the deflationary token property, after every transfer the owner balance must be increased by fees.
- **ownership-cannot-change**: The initial owner of the contract defined during the constructor call, cannot change.
- **total-supply-integrity**: After a transfer, the total amount of tokens is always the same.
- **user-cannot-exclude-include-from-fee**: A generic user cannot include or exclude someone in fees payment.
- **validate-transfer-diff-o-s-r**: If owner, sender and receiver have distinct addresses, their balances are updated correctly after the transfer of a positive amount of tokens: Owner balance is incremented by the fee, Sender balance is decremented by the amount and Receiver balance is incremented by the amount minus the fee.
- **validate-transfer-same-o-r**: If only owner and receiver have the same address, we check that their balances are updated correctly after the transfer of a positive amount of token: Owner balance is incremented by the amount, Sender balance is decremented by the amount and Receiver balance is the same as the owner balance.
- **validate-transfer-same-o-s**: If only owner and sender have the same address, we check that their balances are updated correctly after the transfer of a positive amount of token: Owner balance is decremented by the amount minus the fee, Sender balance is the same as the owner balance and Receiver balance is incremented by the amount minus the fee.
- **validate-transfer-same-o-s-r**: If the owner, sender and receiver have the same address, their balances remain unchanged after the transfer of a positive amount of token.
- **validate-transfer-same-s-r**: If only sender and receiver have the same address, we check that their balances are updated correctly after the transfer of a positive amount of token: Owner balance is incremented by the fee, Sender balance is decremented by the fee and Receiver balance is the same as the sender balance.

## Versions
- **v1**: the transfer amount and fees are wrongly managed, the fees are not deducted from the sender but at the same time the owner receives the right fee amount (token duplication).
- **v2**: the deflationary property is not well implemented, when we make a transfer with less than 10 tokens, no fees are charged.
- **v3**: conforming to specification.
