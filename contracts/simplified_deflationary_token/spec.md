This contract implements a simplified version of a deflationary token using `uint256`, where each transaction is charged a fixed fee (10% from the amount of tokens sent).
The contract deployer will get ownership and total token amount and heâ€™ll be excluded from paying transaction fees moreover can decide whether to exclude or include any user from paying them.
