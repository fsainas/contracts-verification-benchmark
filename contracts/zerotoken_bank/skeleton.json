    "name": "Zero-token Bank",
    "specification": "The ZeroTokenBank contract accepts deposits and withdrawals from any address. When a deposit is made, the corresponding amount is added to the account balance of the depositing address. These balances are maintained using a mapping within the contract. To withdraw funds, a user can call the withdraw function of the Bank contract with a specified amount. The contract verifies that the depositor has sufficient funds in their account and then initiates a transfer of the specified amount to the depositor's address.",
